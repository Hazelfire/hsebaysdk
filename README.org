[[https://travis-ci.org/creichert/hsebaysdk][https://travis-ci.org/creichert/hsebaysdk.png?branch=master]]

A Haskell programming interface to the eBay API.

This api is being used by [[http://checkaflip.com][checkaflip]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The api of this package is still undergoing changes and improvements
and is subject to change. I am planning to remove the unsafe (partial)
functions in 0.3 release with a more stablized api./
#+END_QUOTE


* Getting Started

See the [[https://github.com/creichert/hsebaysdk/blob/master/example.hs][example]] for more detailed usage.

Running the example from GHCi:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
    cabal repl
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
    > :l example.hs
    > main
#+END_SRC

/Currently, this module only supports the Finding api./
